  Pyliblinear - a liblinear python API
=======================================

**pyliblinear** is an API for `liblinear`_  without using ctypes. It
aims for more pythonic access to liblinear's features, especially
featuring streams of data and lazy evaluations whereever possible.

Supported python versions are Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.

Beta.
The API is not stabilized yet. There also may be a few kinks here and
there. But generally it works as expected.
