INSTALLATION
------------

it using the usual command:

$ python setup.py install

The command above will install a new "pyliblinear" package into python's
library path.

Additionally it will install the documentation. On unices it will be
installed by default into <prefix>/share/doc/pyliblinear.

For customization options please study the output of

$ python setup.py --help


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

You'll find a user documentation in the docs/userdoc/ directory of the
distribution package. It is installed by default under
<prefix>/share/doc/pyliblinear (e.g. /usr/share/doc/pyliblinear). Further,
there's the code documentation, generated by epydoc
(<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>), which can be found in the docs/apidoc/
subdirectory.

The latest documentation is also available online at
<http://opensource.perlig.de/pyliblinear/>.
